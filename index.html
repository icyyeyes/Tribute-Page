                  <em>Pacem in Terris Award</em> in 1976. <br>
                  In 1979 she recieved the <em>Nobel Peace Prize</em> for work undertaken in the steuggle to
                  overcome poverty and distress, which also consitutes a threat to peace. <br>
                  In 1999 she headed <em>Gallup's List for Most Widely Admired People of the 20th Century.</em> </p>
                <h4>Nobel Peace Prize</h4>
                 <p>In 1979, Mother Tersa recieved the <strong>Nobel Peace Prize</strong> "for work undertaken in the
                 struggle to overcome the poverty and distress which also, constitutes a threat to peace. <br>
                 When she recieved the prize she was asked, "What can we do to promote world peace?" She answered, "
                 "Go home and love your family." Building on this theme in her <em>Nobel Lecture</em>, she said:
                 "Around the world, not only the poor countries, but I foundthe poverty of the West so much
                 more difficult to remove. When I pickup a person from the street, hungry, I gave him a plate
                 of rice, a piece of bread, I have satisfied. I have removed that hunger. But the person that is
                 shut out, that feels unwanted, unloved, terrified, the person that has been thrown out from society
                 - that poverty is so hurtable and so much, and I find that very difficut.</p>

            <h2>Social and Political Views</h2>
             <p>Teresa singled out abortion as "the greatest destroyer of peace today. Because if a mother can kill
             her own child – what is left for me to kill you and you kill me – there is nothing between." <br>
             As the <strong>Fourth World Confrence on Women</strong> in <strong>Beijing</strong>, Teresa said: 
             "Yet we can destroy this gift of motherhood, especially by the evil of abortion, but also by thinking 
             that other things like jobs or positions are more important than loving."</p>
